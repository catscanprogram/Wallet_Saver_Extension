# Wallet_Saver_Extension

A browser extension created to help college students save money. 
Apply this extension to any of your favorite shopping websites to deter you from buying things.

The extensions will censor all images on a page to make browsing products difficult. It will also disable all buttons to make adding
items to the cart impossible. Prices are randomly replaced with other things you should be spending money on instead, and they are boldly 
colored red. H1 headlines are also randomly replaced with "unmotivational" phrases to deter your shopping enthusiasm.
